Programming Lanugage Used: C++

How To Execute The Program:
  Open a Linux terminal
  
	Type make to build the program
  
	Type ./sender keyfile.txt to run the sender
  
	Open another terminal, and type ./recv to run the receiver
  
	Sender will exit after all contents of keyfile.txt are sent
  
	Receiver will run until it finishes reading all the contents and no more messages are passed. 

We did not implement the extra credit.

Our group used Discord for communication and for sharing codes. The members worked by themselves on their own versions of the program. We discussed errors encountered and possible fixes. In the end we chose the version that compiles and runs correctly, cleaned it up and prepared for submission.
